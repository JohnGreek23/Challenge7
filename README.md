# Work Day Scheduler

Work Day Scheduler is a simple calendar app designed to help you schedule and manage your workday effectively. With this app, you can create, edit, and save events for each hour of your workday from 9 AM to 5 PM. The app provides a visual representation of your schedule, color-coding time blocks based on past, present, and future events.

## Features

- **Current Date:** The app displays the current date at the top of the calendar to keep you informed.

- **Color-Coded Time Blocks:** Time blocks are color-coded to indicate whether they are in the past, present, or future. This helps you easily identify your current tasks.

- **Event Entry:** Simply click on a time block to enter an event or task for that hour. The app provides a text area where you can input your event description.

- **Event Saving:** Events are saved to your browser's local storage when you click the save button within a time block. This means your events will persist even if you close or refresh the page.
